### Assignment
* title **google**
* Create or use an existing programming task in a programming language of a class you are teaching (or would like to teach).
  - The task should involve multiple steps, ~5.
* Run a few internet searches that a student might run when presented with your task.
* In a markdown file:
  - Describe the task
  - For each search you ran provide three links from the results
    - Provide a critique on the result. Things to consider:
      - Was it useful?
      - Was it too simple/complex?
      - Was it unecessarily compicated?
      - Did it include copypastable code?
      - Did you learn from it/could a student learn from it?

  ## Your task - Build a 2 player tic tac toe game in Python
  
# What we are going to do?
You are going to build a two-player tic-tac-toe game, which you can play in the command-line. Initially, you‚Äôll make an empty game board and then you‚Äôll take inputs from the players and we‚Äôll check for the winning condition and if the whole board gets filled and no one wins, we‚Äôll declare the result as ‚ÄúTie‚Äù and ask users if they want to restart the game.

# What will you use?
You will build this game using Python 3, so make sure you have it installed on your laptop/computer and we are good to go.

# What we‚Äôll learn?
After building this game, you can get a pretty clear idea about dictionaries in python, how to access dictionaries, how to iterate over dictionaries, for loop, if-else conditions and functions in python.

# How does the game work?
The board is numbered like the keyboard‚Äôs number pad. And thus, a player can make their move in the game board by entering the number from the keyboard number pad.

# Code Timeüíª
First, let‚Äôs see how we are going to use a dictionary to create our game board. A dictionary is a primitive data type in python which stores data in ‚Äúkey: value‚Äù format. and thus, we‚Äôll create a dictionary of length 9 and each key will represent a block in the board and its corresponding value will represent the move made by a player. and we‚Äôll create a function printBoard() which we can use every time we want to print the updated board in the game.

Create or build a tic tac toe game involves understanding the following skills and ideas:
1. The rule of the game
2. Making a board (lists, 2d rays in python)
3. Using loops and functions

It is really not a complicated task but it is very useful application in Python. So, the best and the most fun way to learn any programming language for me has always been by developing a fun project like a simple game or some project that I would use in my daily life.
So, when I started to learn Python, I started with this No Starch Press published book ‚ÄúAutomate The Boring Stuff With Python‚Äù which is just awesome and If you are looking for a book to get started learning python, I would recommend you to go through this book. Its very beginner-friendly and it covers almost all the basic topics of python. So, while solving the exercises in this book, I came across this TicTacToe game implementation in python.
