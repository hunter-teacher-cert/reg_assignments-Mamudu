# Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went poorly.
I was doing a live coding in python on loops. I wrote the codes and HIT run. Unfortunately, nothing happened.

# Why do you think it didn't go well?
Many student got stucked with me and I had to teach the lesson again. And we were unable to debug the codes due to syntax errors.

# What would you do (have you done) to make it better?
I had to do the lesson again during my prep. So for the second time, I already had done my homework and it was a matter "copy and paste" on the smartboard.

# Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went really well.
My students and I always love tracing codes. So we traced some loops from pseudocodes as mini-lessons step by step.

# Why do you think it went so well? ‚Äù
Most of the students were able to trace their codes very succesfully without any help from me. I usually assign the code tracing assignments on Delta Math.
