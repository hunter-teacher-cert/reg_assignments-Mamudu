# Differentiation and Students with Learning Disabilities (SWD) always require attention from educators!!

Differentiated assessment is the way by which teachers modify and match assessment with the varied characteristics/profiles of students in order to meet the students’ individual needs, thereby enhancing their learning and boosting their ability to show what they have learned. Students differ in their previous learning experiences, readiness, learning styles, preferences, academic standing, abilities, strengths and weaknesses, culture, race, and backgrounds.

Teachers use differentiated assessment to match and respond to the varying learning needs of diverse students in a classroom.

By differentiating assessments, teachers help diverse students to successfully demonstrate their competencies in particular ways that are fitting and effective for them. By providing various assessment methods/activities appropriate for particular types of students, the teachers are able to meet the students’ individual needs, thereby helping them to be successful in their learning.

Designing various assessments apt for specific groups of learners provides more opportunities for students to effectively demonstrate what they have learned.

Differentiated assessments also guide teachers on how they can differentiate, modify and improve instruction.

Differentiated assessments can be done by designing and providing various assessment methods and activities that are appropriate for each type of students such that they can effectively learn and demonstrate what they have learned. Differentiated assessments can be done by providing them various options and opportunities to show their learning and proficiency. 

# From a list of Zach Burrus, Dave Messer and Judith Dodge, here are some ways of differentiating assessments:

Designing tiered activities

Scaffolding struggling learners

Challenging advanced learners with more mid-stimulating activities

Adjusting questions

Compacting

Flexible grouping

Flexible assignments and tasks based on students’ learning styles

Learning contracts
