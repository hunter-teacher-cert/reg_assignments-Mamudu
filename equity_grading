    # Do you agree with the general sentiment or not?
    Yes I agreed with the sentiment generally that there should be equity in grading.
    
    # Do yo have specific points of agreemnt/disagreement?
    I do like points on;
    
    1. Using rubrics
    
    2. Using scale from 1 to 4
    
    3. Mastery of Skills
    
  # For those of you currently teaching: Do you think that you would be able to implement some of these ideas in your class? If not, what would keep you from doing so?
  
  I do use scale from 1 to 4. Teaching specific skill for mastery and grading based on participation and efoort.
