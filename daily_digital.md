"The point is that he has the capability," Biden told the Business Roundtable Quarterly Meeting in Washington. "He hasn't used it yet, but it's part of his playbook."
In a March 18 advisory to US businesses obtained by CNN, the FBI warned that hackers linked to Russian internet addresses have been scanning the networks of five US energy companies.
And experts have warned of 'significant' vulnerabilities in US systems that Russian hackers can exploit, as evidenced by attacks last year that breached Florida's water supply, hit one of the world's largest meat producers and shut down one of America's largest fuel pipelines for several days.
"The threat will probably continue long after this conflict is over," David Murphy, cybersecurity manager at accounting firm Schneider Downs and a former National Security Agency analyst, told CNN Business. "I think it'll just increase with time."
