Write a program that takes three numbers as input from the user, and prints the largest.

# Input values:

Enter a number: 20 

Enter a number: 50 

Enter a number: 5 

# Output value:

Largest: 50

Hint: Remember that the numbers should be compared numerically.  Any input from the user must be transformed into an integer, but printed as a string.

# Code solution: 

a = int(input("Enter a number: "))

b = int(input("Enter a number: "))

c = int(input("Enter a number: "))

print("Largest: " + str(max(a, b, c)))

This will print the largest number!!!
